For my Project 1 report, the biggest areas of improvement were in making sure some of my calculations had the output clearly displayed, clearly scaling visuals, not writing results within comments, and making sure my voice was audible in the presentation.  
My correation matrix graph could have been formatted better to clearly show the labels for numeric variables instead of them being scrunched up. 
My visualization for the mean natural gas consumption could also have been improved if I had formatted the x-axis labels for the states better.
 I also missed clearly showing the output for my mean renewable consumption data with the appropriate units in BTU. I could have also done a better job at interpreting the first two principal components to understand which energy sources were the most reliant in the US.
