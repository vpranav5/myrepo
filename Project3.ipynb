        "\n",
        "As recently experienced with the Texas snowstorms, the reliability and efficiency of the energy grid is crucial to maintaining a basic quality of life for an individual.\n",
        "Issues with power can cause widespread chaos and quickly shut down the fundamental functions of modern society. The key issue made relevant by these Texas storms is the impact of climate change and the need for a continued reliance on renewable energy. With this issue in mind, I became curious as to the main sources of power running all the states across the country. In addition, I began to wonder how much of the country had already transitioned to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal and how many states still had a majority dependence on non-renewable sources like natural gas and coal. \n",
        "\n",
        "To answer these questions, I chose two datasets that together provide the energy sources by state from 1960 - 2014 as well as region/division identifiers for each state. \n",
        "The main advantage I have in grouping these two datasets is to be able to group states by region and identify the main sources of energy. \n",
